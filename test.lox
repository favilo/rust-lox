// This program relies on the fact that assignments return the assigned value
// And that the logical OR operator short-circuits
// So, if the first assignment is truthy, it wouldn't proceed to the subsequent assignments
// And then prints the assigned values
var a = "foo";
var b = "foo";
(a = false) or (b = true) or (a = "foo");
print a;
print b;
